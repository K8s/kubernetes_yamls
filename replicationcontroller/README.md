A ReplicationController ensures that a specified number of pod replicas
are running at any one time.

For example:
  If there are too many pods, the ReplicationController terminates the
  extra pods. If there are too few, the ReplicationController starts
  more pods. Unlike manually created pods, the pods maintained by a
  ReplicationController are automatically replaced if they fail, are
  deleted, or are terminated.

To fetch all the pods of RC:
pods=$(kubectl get pods --selector=app=nginx --output=jsonpath={.items..metadata.name})
echo $pods

How to scale your RC:
kubectl scale --replicas=3 rc/nginx
