In order to do some maintainence work on the K8s nodes or to upgrade the OS, we
can follow the below steps:

1)Check the PODs running on the node
kubectl get pods -o wide

2)Evict the PODs on that node, which you want to handle the maintainence:
kubectl drain [node_name] --ignore-daemonsets

Now we can run some maintaince work
3)After completion, bring back the node
kubectl uncordon [node_name]

4)To remove the node from the k8s cluster
kubectl delete node [node_name]
