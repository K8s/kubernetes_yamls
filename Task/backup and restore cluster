Backing up your cluster can be a useful exercise, especially if you have a
single etcd cluster, as all the cluster state is stored there. The etcdctl
utility allows us to easily create a snapshot of our cluster state (etcd)
and save this to an external location. In this lesson, weâ€™ll go through
creating the snapshot and talk about restoring in the event of failure.


Get the etcd binaries:

wget https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/download/v3.3.12/etcd-v3.3.12-linux-amd64.tar.gz
Unzip the compressed binaries:

tar xvf etcd-v3.3.12-linux-amd64.tar.gz
Move the files into /usr/local/bin:

sudo mv etcd-v3.3.12-linux-amd64/etcd* /usr/local/bin
Take a snapshot of the etcd datastore using etcdctl:

sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot save snapshot.db --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.key
View the help page for etcdctl:

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --help
Browse to the folder that contains the certificate files:

cd /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/
View that the snapshot was successful:

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --write-out=table snapshot status snapshot.db
Zip up the contents of the etcd directory:

sudo tar -zcvf etcd.tar.gz /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd
Copy the etcd directory to another server:

scp etcd.tar.gz cloud_user@18.219.235.42:~/
